# CLI Sims – Object-Oriented Programming Project (CSC1109)

## Overview

This project is a **command-line (CLI) life simulation game** inspired by *The Sims*.  
You will design and implement a modular simulation system using **Java and object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles.

The focus of this project is **software design**, not graphics.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Apply **object-oriented programming concepts** in a non-trivial system
- Design and integrate **independent modules** using black-box principles
- Practice **team-based software development**
- Experience **realistic system integration challenges**

---

## Project Structure

This project is completed in **two phases**:

### Phase 1 – Module Development
- Each programming team develops **one simulation module**
- The module must interact with the provided `SimCharacter` class
- A report and Javadoc must be produced

### Phase 2 – System Integration
- Teams integrate modules into a **single playable CLI game**
- External modules from other groups will be incorporated
- Emphasis is placed on **interoperability and design quality**

---

## Lecturer-Provided Starter Code

The lecturer provides **two reference components** to ensure a common baseline:

### 1. `Main.java`
- Program entry point
- CLI menu loop
- Demonstrates how modules interact

### 2. `SimCharacter.java`
- Core entity representing a Sim
- Contains attributes, getters/setters, and basic behaviours

⚠️ **Important Rule**

> You must NOT modify the public method signatures of `SimCharacter`.  
> This ensures compatibility when integrating modules from other teams.
